Assignment on Linked List

Task 1: Write a function that does the following task.


Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.


(You must create the linked list and pass the head to the function you created.)


Also, mention the Time and Space Complexity of your solution.


Constraints: 
The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000


Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5] 
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]


Explanation:
Given linked list: head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
Output linked list: head -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1


Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]


Explanation:
Given linked list: head -> 1 -> 2
Output linked list: head ->2 -> 1


Example 3:
Input: head = []
Output: []
