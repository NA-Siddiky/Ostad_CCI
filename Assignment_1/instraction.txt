Assignment on Introduction
Write functions that do the following tasks. Also, mention the Time and Space Complexity of your solutions.


Task 1: 


Given an integer ‘n’, write a function to calculate the factorial of a given non-negative integer 'n'.


Constraints: 
1 <= n <= 10


Example 1:
Input: 5
Output: 120


Explanation: 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120


Example 2:
Input: 4
Output: 24


Explanation: 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24


Task 2: 


A function to calculate the sum of all natural numbers between ‘a’ to  'b'.


Constraints: 
1 <= a, b <= 10^5


Example 1:
Input: a = 1, b = 4
Output: 10


Explanation: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10


Example 2:
Input: a = 10, b = 6
Output: 40


Explanation: 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 = 40
