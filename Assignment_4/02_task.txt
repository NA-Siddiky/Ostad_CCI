Write a function that does the following task.


Write a recursive function to multiply given two positive integers ‘a’ and ‘b’ without using the * operator (multiplication operator). You can only use + operator (addition operator) and - operator (subtraction operator).


Also, mention the Time and Space Complexity of your solution


Constraints: 
1 <= a, b <= 105


Example 1:
Input: a = 4, b = 5
Output: 20


Example 2:
Input: a = 3, b = 3
Output: 9


Example 3:
Input: a = 0, b = 2
Output: 0
