Task 2:


Write a function that does the following task.


Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.


Also, mention the Time and Space Complexity of your solution


Constraints: 
1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 10^4
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.


Example 1:


Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.


Example 2:


Input: haystack = "codemama", needle = "ostad"
Output: -1
Explanation: "ostad" did not occur in "codemama", so we return -1.
