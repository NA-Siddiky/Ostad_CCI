Shortest Palindrome

Problem Statement
You are given a string 

S. You can add some characters at the begining of the string. Your task is to create shortest palindrome by adding some (possibly none) characters at the begining of S.
A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward, for example strings "z", "aaa", "aba", "abccba" are palindromes, but strings "ostad", "reality", "ab" are not.
Examples:
If the given string is "bcba" then shortest possible palindrome is "abcba".
If the given string is "abcba" then shortest possible palindrome is "abcba".
If the given string is "abcd" then shortest possible palindrome is "dcbabcd".

Input
The input consists of one line. A string containing only lowercase English letters.

Output
Output shortest possible palindrome by adding some (possibly none) characters at the begining of S.

Example 1:
Input:
bcba
Output:
abcba
Example 2:
Input:
abcba
Output:
abcba
Example 3:
Input:
abcd
Output:
dcbabcd
